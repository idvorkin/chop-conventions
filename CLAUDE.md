# Chop Conventions

This repository contains reusable development conventions, specifications, and best practices designed to be **pulled into multiple projects**.

## Purpose

These conventions serve as a central source of truth for:

- Development environment setup
- Code standards and style guides
- Architecture patterns
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD configurations

## Usage

Copy or symlink the relevant conventions into your project. The conventions are designed to be modular—take what you need.

## Structure

- `dev-setup/` - Development environment configuration
- `dev-inner-loop/` - Development workflow conventions
- `pwa/` - PWA-specific specifications and patterns

## Convention Updates

**Last reviewed:** _YYYY-MM-DD_

2. **Push improvements** - If you've developed useful patterns locally, submit a PR to chop-conventions
3. **Update this date** - After reviewing, update the "Last reviewed" date above
