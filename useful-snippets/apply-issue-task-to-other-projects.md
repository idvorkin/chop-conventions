I have the 3 projects that are similar create an issue for the other repos that aren't this one: idvorkin/humane-tracker-1, idvorkin/magic-monitor, idvorkin/swing-analyzer.

Clarify the issue text, and keep the issue generic and requirements based, and useful stuff you got in your exploration of the solution, but not at the code/file level.
Include how to verify, ideally with e2e tests, but ut are ok if that makes more sense.
