I'll help you implement the changes described in the `chop-logs.md` file. Let me first check what configuration files already exist in your workspace and then make the necessary changes.

| 📄 `justfile.md` |
| 📄 `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |

</details>

I can see that `.gitignore` and `.cursorindexingignore` already exist. Let me check their current contents and then update them according to the specifications in `chop-logs.md`. I'll also need to create or update `.prettierignore`.

---

Read file: .gitignore

---

Read file: .cursorindexingignore

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase ".prettierignore" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check if `.prettierignore` exists:

---

Could not find file '.prettierignore' in the workspace.

---

Now I'll make the necessary changes according to the `chop-logs.md` specifications:

1. **Update `.gitignore`** - Add `.specstory/**` (it currently only has specific `.specstory/.what-is-this.md`)
2. **Update `.cursorindexingignore`** - Add `zz-chop-logs` (it already has `.specstory/**`)  
3. **Create `.prettierignore`** - Add both `.specstory/**` and `zz-chop-logs`

---

```diff
  # SpecStory explanation file
- .specstory/.what-is-this.md
+ .specstory/**
  .aider*
  
```

---

```diff
- 
  # Don't index SpecStory auto-save files, but allow explicit context inclusion via @ references
  .specstory/**
+ zz-chop-logs
  
```

---

```diff
- 
+ .specstory/**
+ zz-chop-logs 
```

---

Perfect! I've successfully implemented all the changes specified in `chop-logs.md`:

## Changes Made:

### ✅ `.gitignore` Updated
- Changed from `.specstory/.what-is-this.md` to `.specstory/**` to ignore the entire `.specstory` directory
- Kept the existing `.aider*` entry

### ✅ `.cursorindexingignore` Updated  
- Added `zz-chop-logs` to the existing file
- Kept the existing `.specstory/**` entry and helpful comment

### ✅ `.prettierignore` Created
- Created new file with both `.specstory/**` and `zz-chop-logs` entries

All the environment setup requirements from your `chop-logs.md` file have been implemented. The configuration will now:
- Keep `.specstory/**` content out of git tracking
- Prevent Cursor from indexing both `.specstory/**` and `zz-chop-logs` directories  
- Exclude both directories from Prettier formatting
