### CLI usage and errors

    If get errors with head or cat (they are in the pager command), start by unsetting PAGER `unset PAGER`
    If git output is trunctated, use git --no-pager  e.g. (git --no-pager diff)
    Use uv instead of python
    Most required commands are just file. Use them there if they exist.
