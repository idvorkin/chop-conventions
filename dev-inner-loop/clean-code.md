Unless the user asks for this explcility, do the following only for new code, DO NOT change places you are not working on.

Keep code DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
When you find bugs, add unit tests that are red, then turn them grean.
Avoid nesting scopes, try to minimize telescoping
Leave functions as soon as you can. (Don't apply a comment for that)
Use const whenever you can
Use types whenever you can
Use data objects when you can POJO/POCO, or pydantic objects
Use humble objects (called a manager) when interacting with external systems
